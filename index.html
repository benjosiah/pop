						The value of an object can be measured in its monetary 
						worth, full recovered worth or its importance, but in 
						this case, we are not dealing with objects, but with 
						humans. How can you as a human being analyse or determine
						 your worth? Not everybody knows this. Some people think 
						 there worth is determine by the amount they have in their 
						 bank, some others rate themselves based on the connections 
						 they have and others, on physical and material features. 
						 It’s actually such a pity that people go about thinking 
						 they worth much when actually they worth little, and some 
						 others think they worth little not realising they worth 
						 more. The true value of a man can be measured base on two 
						 important factors, which are;The Investment of your Personality
						The true value of a human is only measured by the investment 
						of his personality, how much he has stored in him, the skills he 
						possesses, the knowledge he has acquired, his talent, all this are 
						he stuff that determine your worth. That’s why you go to school, 
						that’s why you study, attend conferences, read books, listen to 
						inspirational messages, all just to invest in yourself, develop 
						your Skills and improve your worth. The worth of a product is 
						measured base on two important features, and the first is the 
						materials used in producing it. As a human the materials used in 
						building or destroying him are the words he hear and the things he 
						see. So, the first step in improving your worth is to build yourself 
						with the right materials. Filter the words you hear and speak because, they
						are powerful.
